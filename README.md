# liri-node-app
Homework 8 for the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp. LIRI is a SIRI-like personal assistant that uses typed commands via a CLI.

## Setup
You will need to add a `log.txt` file to your repo when you pull it down. Keep it top level. You will also need a `keys.js` file where you keep your Twitter keys.

## Using LIRI
Navigate into the repo via the command line, and then enter:

`node liri.js`

You will then be prompted with 4 search options: Spotify, OMDB, Twitter, and a wildcard.
Searching with Spotify or OMDB will prompt you to search for a track or movie, respectively.

Twitter will give you my last 20 tweets (sorry they aren't yours).

Random is a surprise.
